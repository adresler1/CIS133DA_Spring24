I have updated the description of the midterm project to include
all the correct items you are supposed to do. I have also placed
a copy of a style.css there that you can download. This CSS file
will modify your header and footer to fit at the top and bottom
of your page.

You should make any other modifications to the selectors for the
headers and footers as you need, such as changing the gray to a
color of your own choice, or maybe trying to center themenu items
across the top of the page, etc.


Have a great spring break.

PS. I forgot to mention that you will have more than one chance
to get your midterm project right. When you first turn it in, I
will probably send it back to you with some comments for how you
might improve it. So be brave. Do your best, and turn it in on time.
